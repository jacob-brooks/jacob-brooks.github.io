        <h1>Project 1: Predicting and Enhancing Employee Performance Through HR Analytics</h1>
        <div class="section">
            <strong>Team:</strong> Cali Hugelen, Edith Tache, Jacob Brooks, Remington Webb<br>
            <strong>Date:</strong> Summer 2024

        <div class="section">
            <p>In the competitive landscape of modern business, optimizing employee performance is crucial for organizational success. Our project leverages HR analytics to predict and enhance employee performance by analyzing a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Project Goals:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Identify Key Predictors:</strong> Uncover the most significant factors influencing employee performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluate Recruitment Channels:</strong> Assess how different recruitment channels impact performance outcomes.</li>
                <li><strong>Assess Training Programs:</strong> Determine the effectiveness of training programs on performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Develop Predictive Models:</strong> Create a model to forecast employee performance and provide actionable HR recommendations.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Methodology:</h2>
            <p>Our approach includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering. We employed various machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines—to predict performance, with a focus on hyperparameter tuning for optimization.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Key Findings:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Top Predictors:</strong> Previous year ratings, average training scores, and length of service are significant predictors of performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Recruitment Channels:</strong> Different channels show varying impacts on performance, with 'Other' and 'Referred' channels performing better.</li>
                <li><strong>Training Programs:</strong> The number of training sessions alone does not directly correlate with performance improvements; the quality and relevance of training are crucial.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Recommendations:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Enhance Training Programs:</strong> Focus on quality and relevance rather than quantity.</li>
                <li><strong>Optimize Recruitment Channels:</strong> Strengthen effective channels and refine sourcing strategies.</li>
                <li><strong>Leverage Predictive Insights:</strong> Utilize the developed model for data-driven HR decisions and performance monitoring.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
            <p>This project demonstrates the power of HR analytics in transforming employee performance strategies. By implementing the findings and recommendations, organizations can improve their hiring processes, enhance employee development, and boost overall productivity.</p>
